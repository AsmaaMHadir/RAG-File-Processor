# üìÑ Document GPT - FastAPI Backend

Expanding on his work to allow supporting larger datasets

This FastAPI backend serves as the core API for handling document uploads, processing PDF files, embedding document content into a vector database , and allowing users to ask questions based on the uploaded document. The AI model uses OpenAI's embeddings to generate intelligent responses from the document content.

### üõ†Ô∏è Features
 - **PDF Upload:** Upload PDF files to be processed and stored in a vector database  for querying.
 - **Question & Answer System:** Users can ask questions based on the content of the uploaded PDF.
 - **API Documentation:** Automatic API documentation available through Swagger at /docs.

### üì¶ Libraries Used
 - **FastAPI:** For building the web API.
 - **Pinecone Client:** For storing and retrieving document embeddings.
 - **LangChain:** For handling PDF processing and embeddings.
 - **OpenAI:** For generating embeddings and AI model responses.
 - **PyPDFLoader:** For extracting text from PDF files.
 - **CORS Middleware:** For handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow frontend requests from different domains.
 - **dotenv:** For managing environment variables (e.g., API keys).

### üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
 - ```app.py```: Main FastAPI application file containing the API endpoints for PDF upload and question-answer system.
 - ```utils.py```: Contains utility functions for processing PDF files, sending embeddings to the vector DB, and retrieving answers from the embeddings.
 - **Environment Variables:** API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone are provided with the request

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before setting up the FastAPI backend, ensure you have the following installed:
 - Python 3.7+
 - Pip (Python package manager)
 - Pinecone
 - OpenAI API Key (for generating embeddings and responses)
 - Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to set up the FastAPI backend on your local machine:

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-name>
```

#### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage the dependencies:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using ```pip```:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



#### Step 5: Run the FastAPI Application
Start the FastAPI server locally by running the following command:
```
uvicorn app:app --reload
```
This will start the server at ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/```.

#### Step 6: Test the API on Swagger UI
FastAPI automatically generates API documentation, accessible through Swagger.
Open your browser and navigate to: ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs```

Here you can test both API endpoints directly:
 - ```/process-file/```: process file of any of these types: csv, pdf, xlsx, docx, txt
